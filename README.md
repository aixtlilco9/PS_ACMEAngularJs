# PS_ACMEAngularJs

Once more another Plural sight tutorial.
Having gone over it to remind myself of it i see that its a pretty simple web site
however it was made completly from scratch with nothing but html, css, and the use or js libaries one being Angular!!! 
This is probably the project where i have used html and js the most.

This is suppose to be a product management site and shows a few items which are harded coded however new items can be added.
One cool feature that was added was the use of the js library d3/charts which is used for data visualization aka neat charts!
 
 I came to see that angular can be used for alot of things such a to create and use services, UI routing, but mainly for use in 
 tags in html such as with for validation.I hope to later further my famialrity with angular seeing as there may be two forms/types/variations of it(angularjs/2 vs angular6/7 idk).
